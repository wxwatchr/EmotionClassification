Emotion Detection and Classification using Neural Networks

Description: The purpose of this project will be to detect and then classify facial emotions based on images. Emotion detection is already used in law enforcement. An application that makes use of emotion detection and classification could be useful for people with the inability to recognize emotions without assistance (typically people on the autism spectrum).

Data Science Task: Emotion detection and classification will be accomplished by creating a neural network.

Data: Data is available with the Facial Expression Recognition 2013 (FER2013) dataset. The dataset contains over 35,000 images classified as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, fear, and neutral.

Data Analysis: To develop the emotion classification, a neural network will be created. Various convolutional layers and architectures will be tested for accuracy.

Anticipated Difficulties: The data set is already in a useable state and will require minimal cleaning. The most difficult process will likely be finding the best combination of convolutional layers for accuracy. Because of this, the majority of the timeline will be devoted to this.

Timeline: 
Weeks 1-2: Defining/researching problem, obtaining approval 
Week 3: Obtaining and cleaning/preparing data 
Weeks 4-7: Data analysis, best algorithm choice 
Week 8: Presentation Preparation
